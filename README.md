800Club is a local math tutoring center in West Windsor, NJ. The business owner (and sole tutor) currently has over 30 students, but keeps track of records completely on paper. She has run into issues such as double-scheduling, missing payments, and missing student information (such as phone numbers). We built a website for her business to help her improve her operations. Mrs. Ganesh, the owner, tutors students in groups capped at 4. Each student is assigned a 1-hour weekly class slot based on grade/math level. Students pay for classes on a monthly basis.If they are unable to attend a class, they must cancel up to 24 hours in advance and will be rescheduled to another time slot that includes students of a similar grade level. We used these requirements to build a mySQL database for her.

This website gives access to two kinds of users: the admin (one user) and students. The admin has access to her weekly class schedule and info of every student, such as contact info, scheduled time slot, classes scheduled/attended/cancelled, and payment info. Students have access to the records of all classes they have scheduled/attended/cancelled, their payment info, and their overall profile.
